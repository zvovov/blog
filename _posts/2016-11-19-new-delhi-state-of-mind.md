A new city, a new language, a lot of new people and some old friends. But the pleasant weather _trumps_ all. Heh.

It's been a couple of weeks since I left my city, New Delhi, the city I was born in, in pursuit of greater things. Leaving home is never easy. But it doesn't really feel like leaving home to me.

New Delhi suffered incidents marred by withdrawal symptoms as soon as I left. The city [choked](www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/world/asia/india-delhi-smog.html). But time heals all. Slowly, it's getting back on its feet. Saying that I have been completely unaffected by moving out would not be an absolute truth. [^1]

It would be fundamentally impossible to identify what part of my personality was shaped by New Delhi. There are no separating lines. I think all of me is the the city I grew up in... or none of it. It's hard to tell.

At times I feel I am still there, so I guess it doesn't make a difference. As long as you're surrounded by people you know or people you want to know, doing things you like to do or heading to choppy waters learning as you go, the place won't make a difference. At any point on Earth or outside, home is something you carry within you.
