**Call** me Saleem. Some years ago - it does matter how long precisely, four years ago - having little or no technical knowledge in my technical knowledge account [^1] and nothing particular to interest me on the professional education island, I thought I would sail about a little and read the literary marvels of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the monotony and regulating the circulation of intellectual juices.

Now this particular literary marvel came into my possession in the first year of my four-year course and I, in my naivety, proclaimed that it - the near six hundred and fifty page monstrous beauty - would be back in the original owner's hands by the end of the second month. I was a deer on the road facing the lights, and I jumped right at the car. It took me forty eight months. And the owner didn't see the book again. In my defense, he did get a book (a different one) presented to him and signed by yours truly. Now, in my hands was the first Booker of Bookers - a vintage paperback by Salman Rushdie - Midnight's Children. 

**Whenever** I found myself growing grim about the course syllabus; whenever it was a gloomy dark December in my soul; whenever I found myself involuntarily pausing before the strips of grass and trees between the even numbered blocks of the campus building and the playing field, and pondering about the future; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the coaches of Delhi Metro, and methodically knocking people's phones off from their hands (cause they rarely wear hats now)â€”then, I account it high time to get to my backpack and reach for the book as soon as I can. 

On and off and on I read the chronicle of a lineage, produced by its faux-grandson Saleem, over a timeline that held the date hour minute and second of India's independence at the median. There were times when the book stayed shut for months at a stretch. But eventually, as with all things, the book neared its end. It spanned all four years of my course. It was ironic how just a week after I received my course completion certificate, I finally witnessed the closure I was reading towards for so long. The end had a calming effect, similar to what the ocean has on some people.

**If** they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

On to the next one.
