Everyone has two sides to them - One is Love (loved ones and/or for family) and the other is ambition (money and/or power). This is a story about someone who, somehow, finds a balance between the two and manages to get all of the above.

* Charlie - Money (gambling) & family (with Guddu)

* Guddu - Love (with Sweety) & family (with Charlie)

* Sweety - Love (with Guddu) & family (gangster-turned-poitician's sister)

* Bhope Bhau - Politics (Power + Money) and family

* Mikhail - Money (gambling, drugs) and family

* Tashi - Money (diamonds, drugs) and family

* Narcotics Police Brothers - Money (corrupt police officers) and family (brothers)

* Narcotics Police - Money and Duty

Everyone who chooses Money over family dies - which is everyone except Guddu and Sweety. Everyone else dies because they chose the wrong side of Yin and Yang. Well, everyone except our boy-with-the-blinders Charlie. He manages to balance money and family. He unlearns to let his greedy side be his dominant side and becomes a changed man with the same dreams, but a little less greed (last part inconclusive).

Jack Black makes an appearance as Charlie and Guddu's father, but not really!
