# A conversation between two voices


#### _I feel obligated to state this..._

  
Just say it.

#### _It's not... That's not how... **You** don't get to do this. It's not your place. Your opinions are your own. And they don't deserve a pedestal._

I know.

#### _So it's never gonna work. You'll be here all alone, pouring your thoughts away, thinking hoping bemoaning how this never became a thing. I'm telling you right now, it won't. Ever._

I'm okay with that.

#### _Did someone put you to it? Is that what you think is required of you? Aren't there better things to do? Is this worth your time?_

See, I'm doing this so that I can look back. Rather than relying on memory, which is fickle and easily contorted, I want to have personal anecdotes to take me down the memory lane. Right now, if I try to recall what went on in my mind when I was 16, I draw a blank. I don't want it to be this way. It's as if I'm overwriting older memories with newer ones.

It goes without saying that the _subject_'s personal written account of events always helps in making the artificial brain feel more like the _subject_'s real brain. Being conscious forever (albeit artificially) is a great incentive to maintain a blog. So there's that.

#### _Meh_

Yeah.
