The feeling when you discover the thing you enjoy the most is liberating and immensely powerful. So powerful that you forget how liberated you are in the moment. You're still in that zone. The zone is a place you visit alone, and if you're extraordinarily good and acutely aware, you can take others with you - using the power of words alone (case in point, Hitler with his charismatic propaganda and the numerous God-men that people tend to follow so blindly). 

Now, all modern day first world miseries are just puny meteors revolving around this planet of a problem - People not able to find their indulgence. Men - dubious, anxious and hesitant - looking at their problems of not being able to find their calling, but not trying anything new and staying wherever they currently are. They may have seen Fight Club 17 times, but it is still just a "movie" to them, something they draw motivation from, one 6 pack at a time. Thinking about your problems seems more romantic than finding their solution.

Humans have found their indulgences in uncountable places, in a variety of ways. We copy the "Gods", the "superstars" (whoever/whatever that is to us) and hope to be them one day. This method to find our indulgence could be summed up in the quote "Fake it till you make it". Fake it till you believe it yourself. Maybe that is what a "superstar" is - someone who has successfully fooled themselves into believing that they have made it. Our societal setup can't stand such pure confidence. Hence, they make way. You pass through. You are one of others now. You are there. And it is no different here, you feel. The white-hazy Harry Potter heaven is not so exclusive; there is no heavenly glitter; there is no "God"; at least none like what you thought of.
