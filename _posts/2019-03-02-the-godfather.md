From the Don:

* Let me lay it on the line...
* The art of negotitation is to never get angry. Never make a threat. Reason with people. Ignore all insults, threats
* Insist on hearing the bad news at once
* Have Di Nobili cigars; Havanas if they don't hurt your throat
* Get some sleep tonight. You look like the devil himself. Take care of yourself, you won't be young forever
* How a man makes his living should not be your concern
* Smile. It takes the sting out of your words
* Show people the ropes
* Young people, no matter how talented, don't reason things out and they want all the water in the well
* Old roosters can't greet the Sun
* Don't let anybody kid you. It's all personal, every bit of business
