I write about what I think is worth reading, for me or for my fellow earthlings. If you happen to be outside that relatively big (or small) set, you may continue, as you please. No harm was ever meant to you and I hope you repay that kindness.

Software development, bodyweight fitness, languages (programming and spoken), minimalist design, science fiction are among the things that interest and inspire me.

If there are unusually long periods of no writing, know that I am binge watching a tv show, or reading a book, or exploring wildernesses or am too tired from running a marathon. One of these may be a lie.
